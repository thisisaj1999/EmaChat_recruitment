            MVC means muted video chat. This isn't your typical video call. The
            audio call is muted by default, but you can see your special one's
            face and messages are floating in front of you. Therefore, you'll be
            able to chat and video call together.

            If we don't have adequate privacy in a video call, we can't always
            say everything. EmaChat allows you to chat and video call at the
            same time in this scenario.
