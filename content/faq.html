              Obviously, you can use it at night. Come home after a successful
              day, finish dinner, go to your room, close the door, switch off
              the bright lights, and put on the dim lights. Close any
              background apps and open EmaChat to communicate with your
              special one. You will feel as if both of you have entered a
              parallel universe where no one is present. Start MVC with a
              romantic melody playing and solely feel the emotion of love.

              What is the meaning of Privacy?</br></br> - Privacy is the information
              that we don’t want to disclose to anyone.Revealing everything
              can help you sometimes, but the same thing will create a privacy
              issue for yourself.</br></br>In Oatsapp & Nessenger - When we are online in a messaging app then it is good when friends and family can see that you are now online.
              But suppose, I want to chat with my special one at midnight (which is the case with most of the couples) and don't want to disclose that I am now online then what? They have no option. Even in social media messaging apps.</br></br>In EmaChat - For these situations, we need a private space like EmaChat which is only designed for you & your special one. If you want to spend quality time with your special one then definitely EmaChat has to be your only choice.</br></br>Other messaging apps are for friends, family, school, college, groups, businesses, etc.
              But EmaChat is the ONLY application for you when you want to spend quality time with your lover.

            EmaChat is known for its private communication that has no security.</br></br>EmaChat never asks for any of its user's personal details like mobile number, email address, name, etc.
            EmaChat does not have any unique identity. It generates a new chat ID for the users every time.
            The messages, photos, and files are instantly deleted.</br></br>That is how your online privacy is safe and secure. But, a question arises: can anyone hack into your EmaChat?
            If they want to, they also need a unique identifier to track you at first. In EmaChat, you have no unique identity. So it is not possible to hack your EmaChat.</br></br>EmaChat strongly believes that - 'We need a secure place for our special one. Because there should be no compromise when it comes to the safety and security of your loved one.'

            When you send a message from your phone – it will deliver a ping to your special one’s phone. When they open it and you both come online - Your message will be delivered. During this time, the messages are just stored as RAM in your phones. We know that RAM can store data temporarily. When you click the back button or close the app or reload, all the data is automatically erased, permanently. That is how RAM works. So now you have the answer to the question - How secure is EmaChat?
