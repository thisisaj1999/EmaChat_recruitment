            Normally, we wait for our special one to message us. Whenever you
            notice that your special one is typing. You simply begin doing

            But on EmaChat you can see every letter that your special one is
            typing. Like a live chat. And you donâ€™t have to wait for them to see
            your messages while they are offline, here NO one can send a message
            while the other one is offline.
